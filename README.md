## General Info
This is a fully functioning & responsive weather application that was created using javaScript, HTML, and CSS. This weather app includes a map plugin, a table that displays various weather data, customized weather icons, daily and forecast data, and the ability to switch between metric and imperial units. This application was a total rehall of my older weather app (which can be viewed here: https://weather-app-leopoldov95.netlify.app/) and my goal was to greatly improve upon the UI for the application and to add extra features. Also I was motivated to use the newer concepts I have been learning to make this application much nicer.

## What I Learned
This was a totall rehall from my older weather app that I have created. When I created the first version, I wasn't too happy about the results, but I lacked the skills to make it look nicer. Now that I have learned more about front end technologies, I decided to go back and make the application much better. I learned that I should be more comfortable tackling on challenges even if they may appear to be very difficult (examples included adding the map, having my own weather icons, and making a dynamic SVG meter), at the end of the day, pushing myself is what will allow me to learn more. 

In this version of the app I used ES6 import/export features to make my javaScript files cleaner and I had a better usage of async/await when making http requests.
